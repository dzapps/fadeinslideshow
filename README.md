# Introduction to the Storyteller Image Slider.

Storyteller is a jQuery Image Slideshow with Fade-in Effect. 
It comes handy when all your photos are part of one story and you want the slider to deliver that story to the visitors of your website. 
You can have unlimited number of images with relatively long captions. Slider will show captions sentance by sentance, with gradually increasing
font sizes.  

This is the initial version of the Storyteller that I developed mostly for learning purposes so code needs to be further revised. You are welcome to modify it.

## Getting Started

- Create `css`, `js`, and `images` folders and copy all files from this repository into respective folders:
    **in your `css` folder, you should have `slideshow.css`, `skeleton.css`, `normalize.css`, and `jquery.jscrollpane.css` files;
    **in your `js` folder, you should have `slideshow.js`, `jquery-3.2.1.min.js`, `jquery.jscrollpane.min.js`, and `jquery.mousewheel.js`
    **copy all photos to your `images` folder.
- Copy the content of `index.html` to your `html` file, make sure that all `.css` and `.js` files are linked correctly, and 
  open file in your favorite browser.
  
  This will replicate the slider from the repository. To customize it for your own needs, replace files in `images` folder  and update `<src>` attributes of 
  your `<img>` tags and respective captions in `<p class="caption">...</p>` in your `html` file.
